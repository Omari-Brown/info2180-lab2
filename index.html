                    <h2>The Benefits of Exercise.</h2>
                    Posted on <time datetime="2021-10-01 11:45"> October 1</time> by Omari Brown.

                        Do you exercise regular? Well you should. Today I will be outlining 3 benefits of regular exercise. 
                        Firstly, exercising promotes good health and fitness. It helps to strengthen your muscles while burning that excess fat. 
                        This fat could end up blocking your arteries, thereby causing a stroke. Depending on where the stroke occurs it could be fatal 
                        or leave you severely debilitated. So exercising daily could just save your life. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second benefit of exercise is that it makes 
                        you more disciplined. Excerise is both a good way to start and end your day. It is so easy to take that extra hour in the mornings 
                        to sleep or to just skip a day of excercise because work was stressful. It takes discipline and great will power to follow your 
                        exercise plan. And if you can stick to your plan. Then you can accomplish any goal you set out to achieve no matter the challenges.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally exercise helps you to relax, relieve stress and improve your mood overall. When you exercise endorphins are released 
                        into to your body to reduce your perception of pain. The resulting effect is that you feel positively energized and stress free.

                    <h2>The Rise of Anime </h2>
                    Posted on <time datetime="2021-09-22 18:30"> September 22 </time> by Omari Brown.
                    <p>
                        Animation has long been at the heart of Japanese culture. It is in recent years that it has become increasingly popular in the Western 
                        Hemisphere. Its current market value is about $25.46 billion in USD and is expected to grow by 9% annually. Anime has changed the 
                        <img src="anime.jpeg" alt="Anime characters poster" width = 160px height= 285px> status quo, it is no longer something that kids watch. 
                        There impactful and interesting stories cater to a wide variety of people. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The success of the recent anime film "Demon Slayer: Mugen Train" is proof of this. The movie surprised many with its $19.5 million 
                        in receipts during its opening week in the United States. The film went on to become the highest-grossing anime film ever with over 
                        $423 million globally. Despite the fact that the film was only available in a few selected theatres and the closure of several entertainment 
                        industries across the globe the film performed exceptionally well. Mugen Train is not the first and it certainly won't be the last anime film 
                        to rock the world.

                    <p>
                        The growth of the anime industry can also be measured and demonstrated by social constructs. It has become common for anime to trending on 
                        social media. Celebrities such as Keanu Reeves, Megan Thee Stallion, Micheal Jordon and Elon Musk have openly admitted that they watch and love 
                        anime. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you haven't started watching anime you should. Some of my recommendations for newbies are My Hero Academia, Naruto and Sword Art Online.
